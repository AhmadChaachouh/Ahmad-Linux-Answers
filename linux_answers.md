1. "ls -l" lists the content of the directory with detailled information about each entry, while "ls -a" lists all files in the directory including hidden files.

2.One scenario is not having the permission to create the directory when working in the /root directory for example. To solve this issue we can use a script to automate handling it:
*****************************
#!/bin/bash

# Directory to be created
DIR="/root/new_directory"

# Function to create directory with necessary measures
create_directory() {
  local dir=$1
  if mkdir "$dir"; then
    echo "Directory '$dir' created successfully."
  else
    local error=$?
    echo "Failed to create directory '$dir'. Error code: $error"
    
    # Handle specific errors
    if [ $error -eq 1 ]; then
      echo "Permission denied. Trying to create directory with sudo."
      if sudo mkdir "$dir"; then
        echo "Directory '$dir' created successfully with sudo."
      else
        echo "Failed to create directory '$dir' even with sudo."
        exit 1
      fi
    elif [ $error -eq 2 ]; then
      echo "No such file or directory. Trying to create parent directories."
      if mkdir -p "$dir"; then
        echo "Directory '$dir' created successfully with parent directories."
      else
        echo "Failed to create directory '$dir' with parent directories."
        exit 1
      fi
    else
      echo "An unexpected error occurred: $error"
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
}

# Call the function to create the directory
create_directory "$DIR"

*********************************
this script checks the error code and acts accordingly using conditions.

3.cat file1 file2 > newfile

4. To use cat for file creation you have to use echo and the '>' operator to add the the text to the new file, if the file already exists iti will be overwritten.
example: echo "hi" | cat > textfile.txt
Touch is used to update file timestamps. Creates an empty file if it does not exist, or updates timestamps if the file exists.
